# 🧠 Task 5 - Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## 🎯 Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

## 🧰 Tool Used
- Wireshark

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Installed and configured Wireshark.
2. Captured live packets using active network interface.
3. Filtered packets by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP).
4. Identified and analyzed key protocol packets.

## 📊 Protocols Identified
| Protocol | Purpose | Example Packet |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| DNS | Resolves domain names | Query for google.com |
| TCP | Ensures reliable data transfer | SYN, ACK handshake |
| HTTP | Web communication | GET request to example.com |

## 📁 Files Included

- `README.md` (this report)
- Screenshots of packet filters (optional)

## ✅ Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in network packet capture, protocol filtering, and traffic analysis.
